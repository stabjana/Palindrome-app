# Palindrome-App

This app provides a textbox where user inputs a word, a number or a phrase.
It will be checked if its a palindrome or not and the result is shown on the page.

## TASK

Ta s k 1 - p a l i n d r o m e c h e c k e r a p p
Create a simple palindrome app in React/Vanilla JS.  
Refactor the same app now in TypeScript  
Use ReactJS to create your app

Keep it short and simple, e.g. a textbox where user inputs word, number or phrase and a label field which shows weather given word, number or phrase is palindrome or not

Feel free to use any react component library or hooks e.g. useState, useMemo  
Use whatever css, styling you learned in other courses
You may use CSS framework if needed e.g. React Bootstrap / Material UI or whatever for styling GUI

## The app

I created a simple header and an input component, and rendered those. For the calculation I googled a PalindromeCheck function that will be triggered ba a button click.
For styling I used Material UI for the UI and AI to create the floating background.
